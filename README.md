## 📌 Project Overview  
The objective of this project is to analyze **employee attrition, satisfaction, and performance** trends to help HR teams build a data-driven retention strategy.  

✅ **Data Preparation & EDA (Python):** Cleaned and transformed the HR dataset for analysis.  
✅ **Business Analysis (SQL):** Wrote SQL queries to explore attrition drivers, salary patterns, and department-level performance.  
✅ **Visualization (Power BI):** Built an interactive dashboard highlighting attrition hotspots, salary trends, and employee engagement metrics.  
✅ **Reporting:** Compiled findings and recommendations in a structured professional report and presentation.

## 🧩 Project Workflow  
### **1. Data Preparation (Python)**  
- Imported and explored the HR Employee Attrition dataset.  
- Checked data integrity, handled missing values, and standardized column names.  
- Created new columns (`age_group`, `experience_level`, `attrition_flag`) for better segmentation.  
- Connected Python to PostgreSQL using SQLAlchemy for SQL-based business analysis.  

### **2. SQL Analysis**  
- Created the **employee_attrition** database in PostgreSQL.  
- Loaded the cleaned dataset from Python into the SQL server.  
- Executed 10+ SQL queries to uncover key insights:  
  - Attrition by department and job role  
  - Impact of overtime and commute distance on attrition  
  - Salary fairness by level and performance  
  - Education and satisfaction correlations  
- Stored and validated results for visualization.  

### **3. Visualization (Power BI)**  
- Connected SQL database to Power BI for real-time analytics.  
- Designed an interactive HR dashboard featuring:  
  - Attrition KPIs and overall rate  
  - Department- and role-wise attrition analysis  
  - Overtime vs attrition correlation  
  - Salary distribution by experience and gender  
  - Employee satisfaction trends  
- Added slicers for dynamic filtering: **Department, Gender, Age Group, Experience Level, Education Field.**  

### **4. Reporting**  
- Summarized all business insights and data-driven recommendations.  
- Added Power BI visuals and SQL outputs into a clean professional report.  
- Prepared a presentation deck for stakeholder communication.
